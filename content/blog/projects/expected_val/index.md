### Abstract

This paper investigates the expected distance of random interior points to the nearest face in an n-dimensional hypercube, with applications to optimization algorithms in machine learning. We derive closed-form expressions for these distances and demonstrate how these insights can be applied to improve sampling strategies and convergence rates in stochastic optimization methods used for training neural networks.
