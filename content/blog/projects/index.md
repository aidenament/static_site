Welcome to my projects page! Here you'll find a collection of my work in mathematics, computer science, and machine learning. Each project represents a unique challenge I've tackled, showcasing my skills in different domains of computational thinking and problem-solving.

## Project Directory

- [**Uniform Convergence and Infinite Series**](/blog/projects/uniform_sum) - An exploration of uniform convergence properties in infinite series and their applications.
- [**Hartogs' Extension Theorem**](/blog/projects/hartogs) - A study of holomorphic functions in several complex variables.
- [**Conformal Mapping Techniques**](/blog/projects/conformal) - Applications of conformal mappings in solving boundary value problems.
- [**Expected Value Optimization**](/blog/projects/expected_val) - A probabilistic approach to optimization problems in machine learning.
- [**Complex Analysis Applications**](/blog/projects/complex) - How complex analysis techniques can be applied to algorithm design.

Each project page contains detailed explanations and the mathematical foundations behind my work. Feel free to explore these topics and reach out if you have questions.
