### Abstract

This paper examines the mathematical properties of conformal mappings and their application in solving boundary value problems. We explore the theoretical foundations of conformal invariance and demonstrate practical applications through several case studies. The results show that conformal mapping techniques provide elegant solutions to problems that would otherwise require complex numerical methods.
