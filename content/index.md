Here's the deal, **I made a website**. 
Well I made a markdown to html parser, then made a website. Why? Because I could.

## About Me

I recently graduated from UCLA with a degree in **math and computer science**. My studies included a range of pure and applied topics, but one highlight of my time at UCLA was studying complex analysis with Professor Terence Tao.

My time at UCLA was split between academics and athletics - I rowed for four years on the UCLA team. Outside of classes and practice, I worked with friends to start the [AI Safety club](https://aisafetyatucla.org/), creating a space to teach the importance of safe AI development and pursue safety related projects.

After graduation, I joined a small startup as a **machine learning engineer** focusing on AI security. I still am involved in rowing: I have transitioned from being an athlete to an assistant coach at Marin Rowing Association. 

It is incredibly rewarding to work with athletes and see them engage with the sport that taught me so much about discipline and teamwork. The balance between technical work during the week and coaching on the water provides a fulfilling rhythm to my post-college life.

### Fantasy Reviews

![stormblessed](/images/kaladin.jpg)

In my free time I like to read fantasy novels. While I fell out of the habit of reading for fun in high school and college, reading **The Wheel of Time** by Robert Jordan reignited my passion. Since then, I've been reading through the genre and made a [goodreads knockoff](https://shutthehellupdaryan.com/) to review books with my friends.
