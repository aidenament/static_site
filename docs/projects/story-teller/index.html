    <article><div><h1>Story Teller AI üêò</h1><p><a href="/projects">< Back to Projects</a></p><h2>An Interactive AI-Powered Storytelling Application</h2><p>Story Teller is an interactive AI-powered storytelling application featuring Boop Boop the Storytelling Elephant, designed to create and narrate engaging stories for children aged 5-10 years old. Originally developed as an interview project for Hippocratic AI.</p><h3>GitHub Repository</h3><p>View the source code and contribute: <a href="https://github.com/aidenament/Story-Teller-AI">github.com/aidenament/Story-Teller-AI</a></p><h3>Overview</h3><p>Story Teller is a multi-agent AI system that creates personalized, age-appropriate stories through an interactive conversation with children. The application uses a sophisticated orchestration of AI agents to generate, refine, and narrate stories that capture children's imagination while teaching valuable lessons.</p><h3>System Architecture</h3><p><img src="/images/Diagram.png" alt="Story Teller Architecture Diagram"></img></p><h3>Key Features</h3><ul><li><b>Interactive Story Creation</b>: Children can request specific story ideas or let Boop Boop suggest one</li><li><b>Multi-Agent System</b>:</li><li><b>Story Selection Agent</b>: Warmly interacts with children to understand their story preferences</li><li><b>Secret Story Judge</b>: Works behind the scenes to enhance story outlines with rich details</li><li><b>Story Telling Agent</b>: Brings stories to life with vivid narration and engaging language</li><li><b>Age-Appropriate Content</b>: Stories are carefully crafted for 5-10 year olds with simple yet rich language</li><li><b>Engaging Narration</b>: Uses sound effects, vivid descriptions, and pacing to keep children engaged</li><li><b>Educational Value</b>: Each story includes a moral or lesson naturally woven into the narrative</li></ul><h3>How It Works</h3><ol><li><b>Story Selection</b>: Boop Boop interacts with the child to understand their story preferences</li><li><b>Outline Creation</b>: Based on the child's input, a detailed story outline is created</li><li><b>Outline Enhancement</b>: The Secret Story Judge silently improves the outline with rich details</li><li><b>Story Narration</b>: Boop Boop reads the enhanced outline and narrates a complete, engaging story</li><li><b>Paced Delivery</b>: The story is delivered in paragraphs with natural pacing for better engagement</li></ol><h3>Technical Implementation</h3><p>The project demonstrates several advanced AI concepts:</p><ul><li><b>Multi-Agent Orchestration</b>: Different AI agents handle specific aspects of the storytelling process</li><li><b>Context Management</b>: Maintains conversation context across agent handoffs</li><li><b>Prompt Engineering</b>: Carefully crafted prompts ensure age-appropriate and engaging content</li><li><b>Tool Integration</b>: Uses file system operations for persistent story management</li></ul><h3>Model Considerations</h3><p>The default model for this project is GPT-3.5-turbo, with specific design considerations:
- Tool usage and handoffs are carefully managed due to model limitations
- The system includes additional guidance and reminders to prevent errors
- Significant improvements are observed when using more capable models like GPT-4</p><h3>Project Structure</h3><pre><code>story_teller/

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ outline.txt      # Generated story outlines</code></pre><h3>Usage Example</h3><pre><code>python main.py</code></pre><p>The application will:
1. Introduce Boop Boop the Storytelling Elephant
2. Ask if you have a specific story idea or would like a suggestion
3. Create a story outline based on your preferences
4. Narrate the complete story with engaging details and pacing</p><h3>Future Enhancements</h3><p>Potential improvements include:
- Enhanced file system usage for character profiles, settings, and events
- Multi-part story narration for longer tales
- Specialized agents for targeted story element improvements
- Shared memory system for complex story development
- Voice synthesis integration for audio narration
- Interactive elements where children can influence the story direction</p><h3>Technologies Used</h3><ul><li><b>Python 3.7+</b></li><li><b>OpenAI GPT API</b></li><li><b>Weights and Biases (for tracking and debugging)</b></li><li><b>Multi-agent orchestration framework</b></li></ul><h3>Educational Impact</h3><p>This project showcases how AI can be used to create educational and entertaining content for children, demonstrating:
- Age-appropriate content generation
- Moral and lesson integration
- Interactive learning experiences
- Creative storytelling techniques</p><h3>License</h3><p>The project is open source and available for educational and non-commercial use.</p></div></article>
